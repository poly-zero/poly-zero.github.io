    <p>If you've seen a picture of the great Pacific Garbage Patch then you already know that plastic waste is a huge problem for the planet.</p>
    <p>And the problem is not limited to plastic waste; the creation, transportation, and even the process of recycling plastic all emit huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>See: <a href="https://www.ciel.org/project-update/plastic-climate-the-hidden-costs-of-a-plastic-planet/">The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet</a></p>
 
    <p>As consumers the most important steps we can take involve reducing the amount of single-use plastics we consume. Steps such as:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Always taking your own bags to the grocery store.</li>
      <li>Using reusable bottles or tumblers for drinks.</li>
      <li>Eliminating the use of plastic straws.</li>
    </ul>

    That said, depending on where you live, it may be extremely difficult to eliminate plastic completely. 
    In that case, one way we can reduce our environmental impact is by of-setting our emissions.
    
    <p><b>PolyZero</b> was created to help consumers calculate the CO2 footprint emitted from single-use plastics and off-set the emissions.</p>
