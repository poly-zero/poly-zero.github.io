      <h2>"The plastic pollution crisis overwhelming our oceans is also a significant and growing threat to the Earth's climate...</h2>
      <p>Nearly every piece of plastic begins as a fossil fuel, and greenhouse gases are emitted at each stage of the plastic lifecycle: 
        <ol>
          <li>fossil fuel extraction and transport,</li>
          <li>plastic refining and manufacture,</li>
          <li>managing plastic waste, and </li> 
          <li>its ongoing impact in our oceans, waterways, and landscape...</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>At current levels, <b>greenhouse gas emissions from the plastic lifecycle threaten the ability of the global community to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C degrees</b>. 
        By 2050, the greenhouse gas emissions from plastic could reach over 56 gigatons—10-13 percent of the entire remaining carbon budget."</p>

      <p>Depending on where you live, it may be difficult to reduce your plastic footprint, let alone eliminate plastic completely.</p>
      <p>Beyond reducing the plastic we consume, one way we can reduce our environmental impact is by off-setting our emissions.</p>
    
      <p><b>PolyZero</b> was created to help Japan-based consumers estimate the CO2 footprint emitted from the single-use plastics they consume in their daily life and then off-set the emissions.</p>
      <p>The goal of our app is first to raise awareness and provide advice and tools for reducing your plastic footprint
        and second, to provide a simple mechanism to purchase CO2 off-sets to reduce the climate impact of the plastics that we are unable to eliminate from our lives.</p>
